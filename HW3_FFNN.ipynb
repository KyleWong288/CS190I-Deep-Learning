The validation accuracy for 5 layers and 10 layers was actually higher than the validation accuracy for 2 and 3 layers. This indicates that 5 and 10 layers may be overfitting, while 2 and 3 layers are a good fit for the complexity of the bag of word embeddings. Also, reducing the learning rate and hidden dimension size helped increase the validation accuracy for MLPs with higher amount of layers, which also supports the idea that we have too many parameters and are overfitting."],"metadata":{"id":"kPo1aS79C1KY"}}]}
